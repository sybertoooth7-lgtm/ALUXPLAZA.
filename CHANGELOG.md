# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Backend and frontend currently version independently
(`backend/package.json`, `frontend/package.json`) — this file tracks
the application as a whole, by date, rather than a single synchronized
version number.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- React admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/submissions`,
  `/admin/security`, `/admin/users`) with client list + risk scores,
  contact submission management, IP block/unblock, and security event
  review — bringing full feature parity with (and superseding) the
  legacy static admin panel at `backend/public/admin/`.
- Platform-wide compliance overview endpoint
  (`GET /api/admin/compliance-overview`) and bulk risk-scoring for list
  views (`computeRiskScoreBulk`).
- Pagination on all previously-unbounded list endpoints (clients,
  security blocks/events, admin users, tool runs, risk-score shares).
- `backend/openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.1 spec for all public and
  client-authenticated endpoints.
- React error boundary (route-keyed, so one caught error doesn't wedge
  the whole app) and a 404 page.
- Backend test coverage for `clientAuth.js` and the `shield/` modules
  (signup, login lockout escalation, email verification, password
  reset, request scanning, IP blocklisting, brute-force guarding).
- Prettier + Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks.
- Dependabot (`backend`, `frontend`, root tooling, GitHub Actions).
- CodeQL and gitleaks CI workflows.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates.
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- One-command local setup (`npm run setup`, `npm run dev` from the
  repo root).
- `engines` field + `.nvmrc` pinning Node 20.x, matching production.

### Fixed
- `adminClients.js`: client creation had lost its `email_verified=TRUE`
  flag, and the compliance-status PATCH route had been overwritten
  with an unrelated `INSERT INTO clients` fragment referencing
  out-of-scope variables — both apparent casualties of a botched merge.
- `email.js`: `isSafeLink()` required `https:` unconditionally, so
  local dev (`http://localhost:3000`) silently swallowed verification
  and password-reset links before they ever reached the dev-mode
  fallback log.
- A stray 1-byte file at `frontend/public` (should have been a
  directory) was breaking every production frontend build outright.
- `express-validator@7` + Express 5 made `req.query` a read-only
  getter, silently breaking `.toInt()`/`.trim()` sanitizers on several
  paginated endpoints (including the pre-existing `/submissions`
  endpoint) — fixed via `matchedData(req)`.
- All GitHub Actions workflows were pinned to `actions/checkout@v4` /
  `actions/setup-node@v4` (Node 20 runtime, removed from GitHub-hosted
  runners in September 2026) — bumped to `@v6` throughout.
- `vercel-checks.yml` contained a genuinely invalid YAML value (an
  unquoted colon inside a string), unrelated to any other change.
- `backend/dockerignore` was missing its leading dot, so Docker was
  never actually reading it.
- Inconsistent Node versions across CI workflows (20 vs. 22) — now
  pinned to 20 everywhere, matching the production Docker images.

### Removed
- Stray AI-tool-generated documents (`VERIFICATION_REPORT.docx`,
  `PATCH_GUIDE.pdf`, `frontend/info.md`) and an orphaned duplicate
  `env.example` at the repo root.
- Unused shadcn/ui components (`carousel.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`,
  `use-mobile.ts`) that were failing lint and weren't imported anywhere.
